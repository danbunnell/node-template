# Node Template

This project defines a basic Node package template for reference when creating new packages.  It is intentionally lightweight, avoids opinionated choices, and may drift over time.

## Package Management
Using the Yarn 2 basic setup for Zero-Installs

## Build
Using an out-of-the-box Babel setup for build

## Test
Using a plain Jest setup with code coverage configured, to encourage high levels of test coverage
